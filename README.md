# Battleship

## Pre-requisites
- Java 8 or above installed

## Specs
- This is a command line, text-only game to simulate battleship against an easy computer opponent
- The game is played between 2 players, who each have a 10x10 grid with rows A-J and columns 1-10
- Ships are all 1 square wide and the player gets 1 each of length 2, 3, 4, and 5.
- Upon program start the computer lays out the ships for both players. Ships can only be horizontal or vertical and cannot intersect.
- The players alternate turns and pick a coordinate to fire upon during each turn.
- After the user selects a square, the computer informs them of the result. If the square has no ship, it was a miss. If the square has a ship that has not been hit, it was a hit. When the user hits all the squares of the ship, they have sunk the ship. When they have sunk all the opponentsâ€™ ships, they win.
- The computer is an easy opponent: it needs only to make a random selection from the squares it has not selected.
- The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate program design and code readability with a program that is relatively quick to implement. **A pretty user interface is not required.**
- We should be able to compile and run the program to see it working
